# Development-of-High-Performance-Cu-Ti-Cr-Al-Alloy
Initiated in July 2025, this project develops a Cu–Ti–Cr–Al alloy targeting ≥80% IACS conductivity, 30–40% hardness improvement, and 25–35% wear resistance enhancement. Processes include alloying, shot peening, and nitriding with SEM, EDS, and mechanical tests for aerospace and electrical applications."
